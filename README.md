# Spider Cop Discord Bot

Discord moderation bot using Perspective API. Everytime a message is sent in a discord server, the text is sent to an API endpoint to determine if the message is toxic, if it is, the bot will punish the users. There is a leaderboard command that is unique per server. Made for Sail hackathon.
